I loved you in the quiet hours
when the world had gone to sleep,
when even the moon seemed tired
of holding what it couldn’t keep.

You were a door half-open,
light spilling through the frame—
I stood outside in winter
whispering your name.

Now every room remembers you
in dust and fading blue;
the silence sits beside me
like something that once was you.

If love is meant to linger,
why does it leave so fast?
Why does it carve its tenderness
into a heart it cannot have?
